## Fictional Movie App 

### Project Overview
You will write server-side code to store a list of your favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. You will then use your code to generate a static web page allowing visitors to browse their movies and watch the trailers.

### Why this Project?
At their core, Full Stack Web Developers are programmers - you just happen to specialize in writing applications for the web! In this project, youâ€™ll write your first application that is accessible via a web browser.

### What will I Learn?
You will learn how to write an application using object-oriented Python. You will then learn how to make this application serve HTML via a web server.
